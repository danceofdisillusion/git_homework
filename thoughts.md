I am starting to understand the terminal
Git makes sense for saving but I don't know yet how to use it to retrieve previous versions or see the commit log
Some of the shortcuts are super sweet, but there are SOOO many.
Shout out to V for sending me all these resources and helping me set up.
I'm not sure what to add here, but I need to make changed to do the next thing.
